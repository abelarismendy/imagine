<b>Context:</b>Culture of recklessness from motorcyclists.<br>

In many cities in northern Colombia there is a culture of recklessness from motorcyclists of all kinds (motorcycle taxi drivers, delivery men, etc) regarding traffic signs. With this project it is hoped to cover the subject in such a way that the player understands the consequences of recklessness in real life. Taking this into account, satire will be used as the main tool to avoid presenting the video game as educational content, so that it can effectively communicate a message.
