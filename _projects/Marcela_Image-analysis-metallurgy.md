title: Automatic image analysis applied to the characterization of microstructural powder metallurgy

description: In this project we created a method of processing the powder metallurgy process known as metal powder. The proposed method analyzes the roundness of pores automatically using image processing, saving time and avoiding errors incurred when analysis is performed manually. The results show that the proposed method is consistent with the manual analysis by an expert.
