The ease of access to virtual reality technology has opened up the possibility of using it as an immersive teaching tool for security measures in risky situations. VR has the potential to solve the problem of information retention, which presents the traditional alternatives, taking advantage of the shock of living the experience and offering a more active role in the learning process.

The project seeks to support the learning of prevention measures and safety protocols that must be applied to be better protected and prepared for an earthquake. This through the development of a virtual reality video game that improves knowledge retention.
