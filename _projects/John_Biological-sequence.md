title: Visualizing Biological Sequence Comparison Summaries for Sequence Alignment Analysis

description: This project consists in a visualization technique to summarize and compare single and multi-queries in biological sequence comparisons. After proposing a taxonomy of existing tools supporting sequence comparison, some analysis tasks were identified and prioritized according to the untapped work potential and relevance to the analyst. This project would be tested along with a group of bioinformaticians.
