title: "The Influence of Metaverse Environment Design on Learning Experiences
in Virtual Reality Classes: A Comparative Study"


description: "We are interested in how metaverse technologies can provide an
environment for future virtual education, beyond traditional videoconferencing technologies. In this study, we investigate learning
and the quality of the classroom experience by conducting classes in
four metaverse environments: Workrooms, Spatial, Mozilla Hubs,
and Arthur. Through the analysis of questionnaires, we assess the influence of factors such as avatars, spatial arrangement, mobility, and
extra functionalities on concentration, usability, presence, and learning. While we did not observe significant differences in learning
outcomes, our analysis reveals substantial variations in the quality
of the classroom experience. Specifically, higher levels of immersion, concentration, and presence were observed in metaverses with
limited movement and functionalities. Also, our findings emphasize
the positive impact of avatars with realistic facial expressions on enhancing the overall learning experience. Finally, we present lessons
learned and offer recommendations for class configurations in the
metaverse based on our questionnaire analysis."
