title: Human-in-the-loop mobile device interfaces for ground vehicles and articulated robots.

description: The lack of a formal taxonomy for mobile devices interfaces for robotic systems is an existing gap. Because of this, mobile device interfaces for ground vehicles and articulated robots are being developed without a proper guide, and this leads to additional trial and error stages or iterations in the development process.
